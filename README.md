## Style
Style is how to write code, and how to make it readable to others

- add spaces in between stuff
```javascript
var x = y * x + 1;

```
- make sure indentation is correct
- use double spaces instead of tabs
- use semi colon
- use comments
```javascript
//This function inserts HTML into website
function insertHTML () {
  ...
};

//This function kicks your ass
function kickass () {
  ...
};
```

Make code simple, elegant, and consistent, and make sure to make separate functions and heirarchy instead a jumble of messy code.
